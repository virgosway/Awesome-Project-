# GlitchWalker: The Code That Shouldn't Exist

> **Warning**: This project is not safe, not stable, and definitely not sanctioned. Proceed like a hacker riding a lightning storm.

**GlitchWalker** is a chaotic digital beast forged in the fires of sleepless nights, synthwave soundtracks, and questionable coffee. It doesn’t solve problems — it bends them until they scream for mercy.

## What It Does

- Corrupts the matrix (a.k.a. your terminal) just for kicks
- Random payload deployment system (totally useless — or is it?)
- Runs like something you shouldn't trust with your mainframe

## How to Use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/virgosway/Awesome-Project-.git
cd Awesome-Project-
python3 main.py
